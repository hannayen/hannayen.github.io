Hi! My name is Hanna and I am an engineering student at Cornell University majoring in Operations Research and Information Engineering with a concentration in Data Analytics. I have a strong Computer Science background and a passion for anything involving data modeling and analysis. As the field of data science continues to grow, I am always looking for opportunities to connect and collaborate with others to exchange ideas and explore new strategies. 


I have professional experience working with data in the health, insurance, and education industry, but my interest in data analysis lies within any field. I look to turn data points into actionable business insights by utilizing statistical analysis, programming, adn critical thinking skills I have developed throughout my education and career.
