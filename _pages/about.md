Hi! My name is Hanna and I am an engineering student at Cornell University majoring in Operations Research and Information Engineering with a concentration in Data Analytics. I have a strong Computer Science background and a passion for anything involving data modeling and analysis. As an inquisitive individual, I am always looking for opportunities to connect and collaborate with others to exchange ideas and explore new strategies.
